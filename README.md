# SyntheticLife
A Reinforcement Learning Toolkit for the Multiverse: Experiments with Synthetic Actors and Virtual Worlds.

## [April 9, 2023]
Initially, I am going to talk about Reinforcement Learning as it pertains to some Bots in SL (yes, pun intended).

Issues:
* Roles vs Skills
* ChatGPT

Topics:
* Sailing, Bot learns to sail in races.
* Soccer, Can we built a soccer game with mixed human players and bots with reinforcement learning and team play.
* Checkers, can we teach a bot to play checkers by playing with another bot.
* Sitcom,  Can we create a Situational Comedy between bots and human players that learns.
* Story Arcs, Can we develop short interactive stories with scenes, themes, a climax (or two) and endings.
